## Notes:
All processing was done in R. The R folder contains the scripts, numbered consecutively, to reproduce the analyzes and generate the figure presented in the manuscript. The outputs folder contains the output files of each R scripts. The starting number of each one of these files-e.g., “0.1.1. Survival time of Drosophila melanogaster across DGRP lines.csv”- identifies the source script, in this case "0_Exploratory_analysis_TDT.r".
To replicate the analyses of the paper, go to the [`R folder`](https://github.com/felixpleiva/Genetic_variation_TDT/tree/main/R) and run the scripts in correlative order.

### Folders:
[`Data`](https://github.com/felixpleiva/Genetic_variation_TDT/tree/main/Data): contain the data which used for the analyses and which are published in [Functional Ecology](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1365-2435.14485)

[`Functions`](https://github.com/felixpleiva/Genetic_variation_TDT/tree/main/Functions): contain the function used to estimate the parameters of the thermal death time curves. The function is part of the paper published by [Rezende et al 2020](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aba9287?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed).

[`Outputs`](https://github.com/felixpleiva/Genetic_variation_TDT/tree/main/Outputs): contain the ouputs files after run the different R scripts.


[`R`](https://github.com/felixpleiva/Genetic_variation_TDT/tree/main/R): contain the R script in correlative order to replicate te analyses and figures and tables presented in the manuscript.

## R packages
The software and R packages associated with each script are enlisted in the corresponding [Outputs](https://github.com/felixpleiva/Genetic_variation_TDT/tree/main/Outputs) folder.
