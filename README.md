Leiva FP, Santos M, Rezende EL & Verberk WCEP. (2022). Data and code of manuscript: Genetic variation on heat tolerance in a model ectotherm. Zenodo. DOI is coming.


## Notes:
All processing was done in R. The R folder contains the scripts, numbered consecutively, to reproduce the analyzes and generate the figure presented in the manuscript. The outputs folder contains the output files of each R scripts. The starting number of each one of these files-e.g., “0.1.1. Survival time of Drosophila melanogaster across DGRP lines.csv”- identifies the source script, in this case "0_Exploratory_analysis_TDT.r".

## R packages
The software and R packages associated with each script are enlisted in the corresponding R session file.
