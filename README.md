## Notes:
All processing was done in R. The R folder contains the scripts, numbered consecutively, to reproduce the analyzes and generate the figure presented in the manuscript.

**To replicate the analyses of the paper, go to the [`R folder`](https://github.com/felixpleiva/Genetic_variation_TDT/tree/main/R) and run the scripts in correlative order**.

### Folders:
[`Data`](https://github.com/felixpleiva/Genetic_variation_TDT/tree/main/Data): contain the data which used for the analyses and which are published in [Functional Ecology](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1365-2435.14485)

[`Outputs`](https://github.com/felixpleiva/Genetic_variation_TDT/tree/main/Outputs): contain the ouputs files after run the different R scripts.

[`R`](https://github.com/felixpleiva/Genetic_variation_TDT/tree/main/R): contain R scripts in correlative order to replicate the analyses, figures and tables presented in the manuscript.

## R packages
The software and R packages associated with each script are enlisted in the corresponding [Outputs](https://github.com/felixpleiva/Genetic_variation_TDT/tree/main/Outputs) folder.
